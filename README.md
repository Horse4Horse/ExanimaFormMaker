# Exanima Form Maker
This is the mostly Proof of Concept project, aimed at making basic UI forms in game. 

## Requirements
Steam version of the Exanima, latest **testing** branch.
Tested against game version **0.9.1.6c Beta**. Other game versions may be not compatible.

## Setup
Project is configured for **v143** toolset with Windows SDK library **v10.0**, it uses std:++latest (C++20 at the moment of writing).
Just compile in **Debug x64** mode and inject the target dll into the game. I'm using [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos) and [Cheat Engine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine)

# Disclaimer
As a very inexperienced windows api dev, I will make a bunch of errors, typos, commits and changes.
Enjoy your suffering while trying to rely on this project.
